# Security Policy

## Supported Versions for security updates

Depending on the version, there is a security team working behind. That means that, supported version have regular security updates. The non-supported versions do not have any security update. The warning sign means that there are security updates, but not regular ones and, these updates, will be stopped soon.

| 12.0.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| 11.0.0  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you report a vulnerability, select your title:
- HGH.IMP.V (High importance vulnerability)
- LOW.IMP.V (Low importance vulnerability)
- V (Vulnerability {usually not requiring any special update})
- EMER.V (Emergency Vulnerability, needs to get an update now)

You can expect regular updates, depending on the importance:
- For the HGH.IMP.V expect an update the same week. 
- For the LOW.IMP.V expect an update the same week.
- For the V do not expect an update.
- For the EMER.V expect an update the same day, within 10 hours.

Once you've selected the title, describe the issue and give enough information. If we need more, we'll be in touch. The ''vulnerability report'' can be done on the ''issues'' page of the project.
